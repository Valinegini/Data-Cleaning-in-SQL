# Data-Cleaning-in-SQL
This SQL project showcases my proficiency in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) by processing a real-world dataset of global layoffs from 2020 to 2023 to uncover employment trends. It begins with importing the raw dataset into MySQL, creating a "world_layoffs" schema, and implementing a comprehensive data pipeline using staging tables to preserve raw data integrity. The cleaning process involves systematic steps like removing duplicates with ROW_NUMBER() window functions, standardizing formats (e.g., unifying "crypto" and "cryptocurrency" industry labels using TRIM and pattern matching), handling null and blank values through self-joins (e.g., populating missing industry data for companies like Airbnb), and eliminating unnecessary columns or rows. For the EDA, I leveraged advanced SQL techniques, including Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for modular analysis, window functions like DENSE_RANK and SUM OVER for time-series and ranking analytics, and proper date formatting conversions to reveal insights such as the industries and countries most impacted by layoffs, the progression of layoffs via rolling totals, and rankings of companies by annual layoffs (e.g., highlighting significant layoffs by tech giants like Google and Amazon). This project demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into reliable datasets, extract meaningful business insights, and follow best practices like non-destructive workflows and systematic data validation.
